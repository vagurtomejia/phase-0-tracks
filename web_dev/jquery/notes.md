#Notes tackling jQuery and learn as much as I can in two hours
##My plan
+ set my phone off
+ steps to follow:
    - look for a good cheat sheet in order to have an overview of the possibilities of the library - bookmark (10 min)
    - look for the oficial documentation. Definition of jquery? Structure? Interesting resources available? - bookmark (10 min)
    - look for a simple tutorial/example to implement (5 min)
    - implement the example(20 min)
    - take a break : 10 min
    - look for some more advanced jquery features (30 min)
    - implement one of them (15 min)
    - look for the information about some feature I would like to implement (20 min)
    - celebrate all the awesome stuff I have just learned by performing my victory dance


##My findings

Interesting links to jQuery documentation:

+ best cheat sheet: [http://jqapi.ru/](http://jqapi.ru/)
+ documentation: [https://api.jquery.com/](https://api.jquery.com/)
+ if you're new to jQuery: [http://learn.jquery.com/](http://learn.jquery.com/)
+ basic tutorial: [http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/](http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/)

##Evaluation of my strategy

What worked and what can be improved in my strategy:
+ Good idea to time each task: improves my focusing and efficienty
+ I did not have enought time for the tutorial so I stepped into the following steps (it was compatible). So after the break I did not followed my plan exactly. Need to take more time to do that next time.
+ I managed to finish in 2 hours the exploration of the jQuery possibilities that where more interesting to me (event handlers mostly) and had a overview of other interesting possibilities.
+ I have implemented all the things I have learned! Keep that!
