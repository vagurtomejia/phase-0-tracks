    - look for the oficial documentation. Definition of jquery? Structure? Interesting resources available? - bookmark (10 min)
    - look for a simple tutorial/example to implement (5 min)
    - implement the example(20 min)
    - take a break : 10 min
    - look for some more advanced jquery features (30 min)
    - implement one of them (15 min)
