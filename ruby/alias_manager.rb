# split full name into first_name and last_name
# for both names:
#   - convert them into arrays
#   - iterate into all the letters (elements on the array):
#     -if the letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u) :
#       change it to the next vowel in 'aeiou'
#     -otherwise,
#       change the letter into the next consonant in the alphabet
# swap the first and last name
# return the new full name
