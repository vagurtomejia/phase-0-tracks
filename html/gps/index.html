Release 4: Reflect
******************
-What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
HTML5 semantic tags give information about the content of a document or section. In my opinion, the most useful are header, article and nav.

-What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The CSSOM and DOM trees are combined into a render tree. This tree is of visual elements in the order in which they will be displayed. It is the visual representation of the document.

-What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learned how to create snippets. I definitly will create more of them!

-What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
What I found most difficult was the understanding of the construction of the render tree, and CSSOM. I will continue to read the ressources I have found about this subjects for a better understanding.
